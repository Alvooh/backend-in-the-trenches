# Production-Ready Backend – 100 Days of Code

This repository documents my **100-day journey to becoming a production-ready backend developer**.

The focus is not tutorials, but **real-world backend engineering**:
- API design
- Authentication & security
- Databases & performance
- Scaling & deployment
- Testing & maintainability

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Django & Django REST Framework
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker
- JWT & OAuth
- CI/CD basics

## Structure
- `day-01` → `day-30`: Daily focused backend challenges
- `day-30-auth-service`: Full authentication service
- `day-50-performance-api`: High-performance backend project
- `capstone`: Production-ready SaaS-style backend
- `docs/`: Architecture, API decisions, and system design notes

## Rules I Follow
- No zero days
- Code every day
- Commit daily
- Focus on production standards, not shortcuts

## Why This Repo Exists
To demonstrate:
- Backend fundamentals done properly
- Ability to design, build, and maintain APIs
- Readiness for real-world backend roles

Final goal: ship a **fully deployed, scalable backend system**.
